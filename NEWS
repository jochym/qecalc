News in version 0.2.2:
- section name of config.ini file can be passed to any task. Allowing to have
- calcs can be initialized by task lists and as well as lists with section names
  from config.ini
- Varables' names corresponding to files from Class "Setting" match ones
  in QE config files.
  multiple sections for one task (pw scf, pw nscf etc)
  renamed:
     pwscfInput to pwInput
     pwscfOutput to pwOutput
     outDir to outdir
     phFildyn to fildyn
     matdynModes to flvec
     matdynFreqs to flfrq
     fldos (in [dos.x]) to fldos
     etc.
- File name variables in Setting('config.ini') have the highest priority. If a
  variable is not there, corresponding QE input file is searched, if it is not
  in the QE input, QE default value is implied.
- set('varName', varValue) and get('varName') are the only supported methods
  to work with class Setting.
- if outdir is not specified in config.ini file, it will be initialized for
  each task from correponding QE input file(if relevant)
- task.syncSetting() needs to be run before output parsing if some of the
  output files are specified in QE input files only. task.syncSetting()
  is always executed on task.launch()

News in version 0.2.1:

- fixed few bugs in parsers
- added outDir variable (mandatory) in [Launcher] section. Each task will
  synchronise its outDir through qecalc.qetask._syncSetting()
- added paraRemoteShell variable (default is nothing) in [Launcher] section for
  parallel remote shell script command (which will prefix mkdir or rm -rf for example).
  Relevant when there is no Network File System (e.g. scratch space)
- added d3 output parser ('d3 tensor')
