There are two ways of installing qecalc. One is easy_install and another is
checking out current development version from our svn repository.


For easy_install option make sure  setuptools is installed and type:

    easy_install qecalc

or for custom location (which has to be in $PYTHONPATH) type:

    easy_install -d $INSDIR qecalc



For svn option, you should have svn client installed
and go through the following steps:

1. Go to your installation dir ($INSDIR), for example, ~/apps and type:

       svn co svn://svn@danse.us/AbInitio/espresso/qecalc

   qecalc project tree will be created

2. Add qecalc to your PYTHONPATH variable:

       export PYTHONPATH=$INSDIR/qecalc:$PYTHONPATH

3. This module also depends on diffpy.Structure package, located at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/diffpy.Structure.

Make sure  setuptools is installed and type:

    easy_install diffpy.Structure


If you already have *.tar.gz source distribution, you may as well just
decompress it and add qecalc to PYTHONPATH
