Quantum Espresso  is widely used GNU distributed open source ab initio package
for plane wave Density Functional Theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics calculations.
Often users need to go beyond basic capabilities of an ab initio program and
use its outputs for more advanced tasks. Some examples:

  * convergence studies of a property of interest with respect to ranging
    values of different input parameters
  * Various optimization and minimization problems
  * Plotting and data processing

QECalc is a set of Quantum Espresso launchers and input/ouput parsers available
organized  under single API.
Its primary goal is to use its classes to streamline user's work flow,
offer new functionality and provide the machinery  to build new  features using
numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
