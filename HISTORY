atomicSpecies is read only property. Should work with QEAtom instances. 
Removed QELattice.save(filename) -> QEStructure.save(filename) should be 
used instead

2010, August 4
Major refactoring of QEStructure.
Changes in interface:
atomicSpecies.pseudopotential -> atomicSpecies.potential

QEStructure.ntyp and QEStructure.nat and QEStructure.atomicSpecies are 
dynamically updated read only properties

QEStructure is a list of atoms and  is inherited from diffpy.Structure, 
all the relevant methods are redefined to preserve the functionality, 
similar to diffpyStructure.

Added methods to QELattice, similar to diffpy.Structure.Lattice

QEAtom is redefined version of diffpy.Structure.Atom - added mass and potential
fields. Also contains QELattice and QEInput pointers. Removed anisotropy 
information
